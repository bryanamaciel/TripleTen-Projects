This was my first TripleTen project, where I analyzed Manhattan's vacation rental market using Airbnb data to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes for investment and estimated potential revenue for top-performing listings.

Description:
This project involved analyzing Manhattan's vacation rental market using Airbnb data to provide investment insights for a client. Neighborhood and property size attractiveness were assessed by evaluating rental frequency through the number of reviews in the last 12 months. Top-earning listings were identified by calculating revenue based on rental availability and adjusted prices. The analysis included data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualizations to offer clear recommendations on the most profitable neighborhoods, optimal property sizes, and potential annual earnings.
