This was the fifth project I completed in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a solo project aimed at demonstrating my skills in building Tableau dashboards and effective data storytelling. The goal was to provide the Superstore CEO with insights into the reasons behind customer returns and offer strategies to reduce them.

DASHBOARD:

This dashboard brings together various visuals to analyze the causes of returns at Superstore, with filtering options by category.

-- Top Customer Returns: Highlights customers with the highest return rates, excluding those with only one purchase. Some customers have a 100% return rate.

-- Top Product Returns: Identifies products with the highest return rates, also excluding single-purchase items. Certain products show a 100% return rate.

-- Returns by State: Displays return rates by state, revealing Utah as the state with the highest return rate.

-- Orders Composite: Compares the number of orders sold to return rates by month to detect seasonal patterns. The top five most returned products are among the least purchased, and returns spike during peak purchasing periods, particularly in August/September and December.
