Analyze why Superstore has a high number of returned orders by joining the Returns and Orders tables and creating visuals like scatterplots, bar charts, maps, and time-based charts to identify return patterns. Build a dashboard in Tableau, starting with three hand-drawn mock-ups and choosing the best design. Create a story arc that explains the root causes of returns, key metrics (e.g., return rate, total cost), and how to use the dashboard to identify issues. Finalize the dashboard with relevant titles and markers, then prepare a 3-5 minute presentation as a screen recording or PDF. Submit the analysis, dashboard, and presentation to help the CEO reduce return rates.
