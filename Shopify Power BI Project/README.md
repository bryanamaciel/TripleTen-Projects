This was my sixth project in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program which focused on applying my Power BI skills. The purpose of this project is to analyze data from publicly available Shopify websites to explore the app landscape and identify key factors that contribute to the Shopify appâ€™s success.

Description:
- This is a three page presentation dashboard made on Power BI.
- Contains KPI cards, charts, and data analysis.

Process: 
*** Part 1: App Landscape
- Created a Power BI page named App Landscape.
- Added a KPI Card showing the total number of unique apps.
- Created a Line Chart of total reviews over time.
- Made a Scatterplot comparing review count and average rating, with a text box for interpretation.

*** Part 2: Reviews
- Created a Power BI page named "Reviews".
- Added a DAX column 
- Displayed the average helpful_reviews in a Card.
- Added ANOTHER DAX column (developer_answered = IF(ISBLANK(developer_reply), 0, 1)).
- Created a Scatterplot comparing average rating to developer responses.

*** Part 3: App Reviews
- Created a Power BI page named App Reviews.
- Established a many-to-one relationship between app_id (Reviews) and id (Apps).
Created Bar Charts:
    - Developer vs. Total rating.
    - Developer vs. Average helpful_review (for more accurate insights).
    - Developer vs. Responsiveness, filtered for apps with over 500 reviews.

The Data:
- "apps": Details of the apps on Shopify apps marketplace
- "apps_categories": Join tables to connect apps with categories
- "categories": Categories of the apps. Each app has multiple categories
- "reviews": Each review (row) contains information on user opinion about the related app (rating and comment). Also, it contains the response from the developer if present.

Initial Assumptions:
- The data showed in the shopify.xlxs file is clean and concise with minimal mistakes.
- The names of columns and data types accurately describe relevent information.
- The data extracted from the Shopify website is accurate to the App Landscape.

Findings: 
-
