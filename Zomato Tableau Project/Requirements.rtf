For this project, I needed to analyze Zomato's business performance by choosing one of three focus areas: Customer Segmentation, Restaurant Analysis, or Sales Analysis. I was expected to develop a research plan, analyze the provided datasets (food, menu, orders, restaurant, users), and create a dashboard showcasing key insights. The final deliverable included presenting my findings in a report or presentation format, demonstrating my analytical skills and ability to provide actionable insights.
To complete the second part of the final project, I needed to submit several files, including a report (.pdf or .doc) with my findings and graphs, a .txt file with a link to my dashboard, and any additional dashboard instructions if needed. If I joined data, I also had to include the final .csv file. All files needed to be saved as a .zip archive under 10 MB and uploaded to the Submission tab.
