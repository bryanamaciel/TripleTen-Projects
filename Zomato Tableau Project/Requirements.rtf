For this project, I needed to analyze Zomato's business performance by choosing one of three focus areas: Customer Segmentation, Restaurant Analysis, or Sales Analysis. I was expected to develop a research plan, analyze the provided datasets (food, menu, orders, restaurant, users), and create a dashboard showcasing key insights. The final deliverable included presenting my findings in a report or presentation format, demonstrating my analytical skills and ability to provide actionable insights.
