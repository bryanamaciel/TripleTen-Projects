This was my final project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was a solo project meant to demonstrate everything I learned throughout the program. The goal was to complete the Zomato onboarding project and showcase my analytical skills to the mock company.

*** Description:

This project focused on Customer Segmentation Analysis, presented in a 2-page Power BI dashboard featuring KPI cards, pie charts, bar charts, and an RFM analysis.

*** Process:

1.) Understanding the Problem: I reviewed the project requirements and approval criteria.

2.) Planning: I chose Power BI as the software and developed the initial Decomposition Plan for the first submission.

3.) Data Analysis & Visualization: I analyzed the data and created visualizations and dashboards for the second submission.

4.) Final Report: I compiled my findings into a comprehensive report for the third and final submission.

*** Data:

I used 2 of the 5 Excel files provided in the Zomato data.zip archive by TripleTen, including:

- 'orders': Order history for all customers and restaurants from Oct. 4th, 2017, to June 26th, 2020.
  
- 'users': Demographic data of customers who completed orders.
   - Additional Tables: Created Measures, Calendar, Segmentations, and RFM tables to support analysis while preserving original data integrity.

*** Assumptions:

- The data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
  
- Minimal missing values won't significantly affect the analysis.
  
- Column descriptions accurately reflect table contents.
  
- The 'orders' and 'users' tables contain all necessary information.
  
- Zomatoâ€™s business context and industry trends were considered in the analysis.

*** Findings:

- Customer Demographics: Primarily 23-year-old unmarried men, with a natural age distribution between 18-34.
  
- Gender & Marital Status: While women are a significant portion, single customers far outnumber married ones.
  
- Family Size & Employment: Most customers have small families (2-3 members), are educated, but unemployed.
  
- Income Levels: Employed customers generally fall below middle class, earning $50,000/year or less.
