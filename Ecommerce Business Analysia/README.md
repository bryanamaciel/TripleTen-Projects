This was my third project in my TripleTen journey. The purpose was to analyze user activity on an e-commerce website by creating a conversion funnel, preparing data for cohort analysis, and calculating retention rates to provide actionable business insights.

*** Description: 
- This project involves analyzing raw transaction logs from an e-commerce website to derive key business metrics. The goal is to build a conversion funnel, prepare data for cohort analysis, calculate retention rates, and deliver actionable insights for the executive team.

*** Process:
- The process for this project began with exploring raw user activity data to understand the types of events recorded, such as product views and purchases. Next, a conversion funnel was created to measure how effectively the website converts product page views into purchases. Then, data was filtered to focus on purchase events, and cohort analysis was conducted by calculating the first purchase date and grouping users based on that. Finally, retention rates were calculated, and the spreadsheet was organized and formatted for clarity before submitting it for review.
  
*** Data:
- 'Business Analyst Project.csv': raw transaction logs
- 'raw_user_activity': Each row represents an activity, or event, by a user on the companyâ€™s website
- 'user_id': unique customer IDs
- 'event_type': the type of activity by the user
- 'category_code': category of the product being viewed or purchased
- 'brand': the company that makes the product
- 'price': price of the product, in USD
- 'event_date': date of the user activity, in YYYY-MM-DD format
- 'Table of Contents': Pre-formated yet empty table of contents sheet
- 'Executive Summary: Pre-formated yet empty executive summary sheet
  
*** Assumptions:
- The "raw_user_activity" sheet provides a complete record of all website interactions during the specified timeframe.
- Any missing data or inconsistencies are minimal and not significant enough to impact the analysis.
- The structure and formatting of the provided data, including columns and data types, are accurate and consistent.
  
*** Results:
- The total conversion rate from view to purchase is about 10%. The view to shopping cart conversion rate was about 29%.
- Retention Rates from the 09/2020 cohort after the very first month was only 13%. By the fourth month, it was lowered to 3%.
  
*** Recommendations: 
- It would be best to focus on purchase conversion & Shopping Cart Abandonment. Perhaps future projects could source product page vs checkout process as a form of funnel deterioration
- Increase customer engagement/feedback through a loyalty plan or customer support
- Continue data insights to follow changes along the cohort analysis
