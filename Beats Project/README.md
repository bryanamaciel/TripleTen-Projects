Starting my journey with TripleTen, my very first assignment was an in-depth data analysis project for Fresh Beats, a music streaming platform. This project introduced me to the core principles of business intelligence and data-driven decision-making, setting the stage for my learning experience at TripleTen.

The main objective of the assignment was to analyze Fresh Beats' business data and provide insights into three critical areas: 
- artist promotion
- user engagement
- genre performance.
(Through this project, I learned how to work with large datasets, clean and preprocess data, and extract meaningful patterns that could inform strategic business decisions.)

Data:

The data presented on Google spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:
- 'sprint 0 BIA Welcome Sprint Project. Fresh Beats User Data': each row represents a unique combination of multiple dimensions.
- 'year': indicates the year the data was collected for each dimension.
- 'user_tier': Boolean data classifying users as either Free or Paid Subscribers.
- 'genre': contains a string value specifying the music genre listened to.
- 'number_of_users': the total count of users within each dimension.
- 'tracks_listened': the total number of music plays recorded for each dimension.

Initial Assumptions:

- Insights and Visualizations Quality: Assumes that the insights and visual representations derived from the data are accurate and reliable.
- Data Availability: Assumes that the dataset contains all necessary information for analyzing user engagement and business challenges.
- Data Accuracy: Assumes that the spreadsheet data correctly reflects user behavior on the Fresh Beats platform.
