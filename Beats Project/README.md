Starting my journey with TripleTen, my very first assignment was an in-depth data analysis project for Fresh Beats, a music streaming platform. This project introduced me to the core principles of business intelligence and data-driven decision-making, setting the stage for my learning experience at TripleTen.

The main objective of the assignment was to analyze Fresh Beats' business data and provide insights into three critical areas: 
- artist promotion
- user engagement
- genre performance.
(Through this project, I learned how to work with large datasets, clean and preprocess data, and extract meaningful patterns that could inform strategic business decisions.)
